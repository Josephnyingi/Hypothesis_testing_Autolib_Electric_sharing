# Description
This project aims to demonstrate the concept of hypothesis testing by investigating a claim about blue-cars using a dataset from an electric car-sharing service company called Autolib.
I will be comparing the blue car usage rates in Paris and Val-de-Marne, which are two French cities. Below are the specific hypotheses of interest in this analysis:
Null Hypothesis: For both Paris and Val-de-Marne the average number of blue-cars picked up during weekends is the same. Ho : μ1 = μ2
Alternate Hypothesis: The average number of blue cars picked up during the weekend is different for Paris and Val-de-Marne . Ha: μ1 ≠ μ2
